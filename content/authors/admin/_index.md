I am a M.S. student at Electrical and Computer Engineering department, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Now, I am working at Michigan Intergrated Circuits Laboratory (MICL) as a research assistant, under the supervision of Professor David Blaauw. My research interests span from digital circuit design to architecture design, including hardware-algorithm co-design, low-power VLSI system design, hardware accelerator and deep learning.
